abstract: "This is a personal article template for RMarkdown. It uses Linux Libertine and Inconsolata fonts, British English, double-spaced text and numbered sections. The colours are personalised too: URLs are in dark blue, internal links are in mahogany and the table of contents is in black. The template also has pre-formatted entries for the abstract, keywords and JEL classification codes. You need to install `R` (and the `rmarkdown` package), `pandoc` and a `TeX` system to compile the pdf. In case you don't want to download large `TeX` binaries, I recommend you to install the great `TinyTeX R` package. A quick note: if you want to use colons in the abstract or the `thanks` entry, please don't forget to put the whole text in quotes. Otherwise, YAML might not parse it correctly. I hope you find this template useful and feel free to send me a message if you have any suggestions."
