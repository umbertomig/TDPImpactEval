abstract: "We study the effect of a mobile phone application designed to increase citizens' ability to monitor public works in Brazil. The app allows individuals to find delayed school constructions in 1030 Brazilian cities and send anonymous messages to politicians requesting information about construction delays and completion times. Our results show the app has a null impact on the completion times subsequently reported by the municipalities. Additionally, we find that few politicians react to citizens' requests. These findings suggest it is difficult to motivate bottom-up accountability in new democracies, especially when politicians are unresponsive to non-electoral pressures. This paper has implications for the design of bottom-up accountability mechanisms."

# Introduction
\label{sec:intro}

One of the key determinants of efficient public services provision is a robust accountability system [@besley2003incentives; @cameron2004public; @ferejohn1986incumbent; @o1998horizontal]. In its standard definition, accountability is understood as the process of holding authorities responsible for their actions [@finer1941administrative; @mulgan2000accountability; @o1990bureaucratic]. Past studies show that accountability has a positive impact on governance, as it ensures that politicians act on behalf of voters [@freire2010ngp; @moncrieffe1998reconceptualizing], reduces the opportunities for rent-seeking and corruption [@deininger2005does; @wenar2006accountability] and improves the efficiency of the public sector [@adsera2003you; @bjorkman2009power]. Recent research also suggests accountability leads to higher economic growth because it limits state discretion in the economy and increases long-term investments in human capital [@benhabib2010economic; @suebvises2018social; @ponzetto2018social].

However, accountability systems take many forms. One promising model is that of _bottom-up monitoring_, in which citizens receive information about the shortcomings of a given project so they can evaluate and pressure underperforming public officials [@kosack2014does; @molina2016community; @raffler2018weakness]. Proponents argue bottom-up accountability is effective because: 1) constituents have first-hand information about the outcomes of local policies; 2) citizens have incentives to attack corruption that directly affects them; 3) policy-makers are sensitive to social punishment from their own communities [@serra2011combining, 570]. In a nutshell, bottom-up accountability offers a potential solution to the principal-agent dilemma in public service by aligning the interests of state officials with those of the constituency they serve [@barro1973control; @raffler2018weakness, 2].

Here we assess the impact of _Tá de Pé_ (TDP), a mobile phone application designed to lower the costs of evaluating public works and punishing political representatives in Brazil. Developed by Transparência Brasil[^transparencia], TDP allows Brazilian citizens to know the location of public school construction sites, check their completion status and anonymously request information from competent authorities. TDP users can also take pictures of the construction sites and submit them to independent engineers for examination. If the engineers classify the construction as delayed, TDP prompts users to send a message to the mayor's office asking for completion estimates and explanations about the construction status. TDP has been online since April 2017 in 1030 Brazilian municipalities and was the winner of the 2016 Google Social Impact grant with more than 200,000 popular votes[^google].

[^transparencia]: Transparência Brasil is an non-governmental organisation whose mission is to 'promote transparency and social control of public power' in Brazil. It has been active since April 2000, is non-partisan and receives no public funding. More information at <http://transparencia.org.br> (access: July 2019).  

[^google]: About 1,000 Brazilian charities participated in the 2016 Google Social Impact Challenge. An independent committee selected 10 organisations as finalists, and Transparência Brasil won the challenge with about 200,000 popular votes. To know more about the contest, please visit <https://impactchallenge.withgoogle.com/brazil2016> (access: July 2019). 

We use the TDP app to conduct two experimental interventions and test its impact on six outcomes related to school completion rates and complaints to public authorities. Overall, our results show that providing information to citizens has very limited impact on policy outcomes. We find that the TDP app increased the likelihood of school completion by 6.8 percent in the first experiment, but the effect is null in the second intervention. We also find that pressure over the bureaucracy increased by 157.5 percent in our second experiment, although not in the first. Importantly, our two interventions have no significant impact on any of the four measures of school investment and completion rates we employed in this study. 

The results raise questions about the ability of citizens to hold representatives accountable using bottom-up strategies. Although studies like @bjorkman2009power, @fiala2017social and @reinikka2005fighting report better policy outcomes after providing information to local communities, our findings are closer to @banerjee2010pitfalls, @keefer2014mass, @olken2007monitoring and @raffler2018weakness and offer mixed evidence that information interventions lead to greater government responsiveness. Our analysis suggests that grassroots monitoring does not affect government behaviour in Brazil, and other models of political accountability may be more effective for public service provision.

# The _Tá de Pé_ Project 
\label{sec:tdp}

The _Tá de Pé_[^tdp] cell phone application is an initiative carried out by Transparência Brasil to foster bottom-up accountability in the Brazilian public sector. More specifically, the main goal of the TDP project is to improve responsiveness in government education expenditures. The TDP app incentivises citizens to provide up-to-date information about unfinished schools in their neighbourhoods, and that information will be assessed by a group of independent specialists. In the case the construction is behind schedule, TDP provides a writing platform whereby citizens can contact their representatives quickly and anonymously. The app then prompts citizen to write a notification to the mayor's office, which has 15 days to reply. If they do not respond to the request, the app forwards the notification to the Brazilian federal government, making it harder to the municipality to access federal funds in the future. The motivation for the intervention is that information delivery causes individuals to closely monitor public works. This, in turn, results in better social outcomes as public agents become more responsive to community demands. 

[^tdp]: _Tá de Pé_ is an informal Brazilian expression for 'is it done?'. Literally, it means 'standing on its feet' in Portuguese.

We built the app in the first three months of 2017 and tested it in May 2017. The first stable Android version was deployed on Google Play on 14 August 2017. A version for iOS appeared six months later. A massive Facebook campaign started in order to publicise the app. Facebook is the most widely used social media network in Brazil with around 72 million users in 2017 [@statista2019facebook]. The campaigns were concentrated in October 2017 and cost US$ 4,479.29. Facebook advertisements attracted 2,028 new users to the platform in October 2017 only.

\end{figure}

Transparência Brasil partnered with the Brazilian branch of _Engineers without Borders_ (EWB), an independent non-governmental organisation[^ewb], to provide technical assessment of school completion rates. The EWB bases their evaluations on photos and GPS location sent through the app. The engineers' reports are later uploaded to the database and stored on the users' mobile devices so citizens can track the progress of the constructions. 

[^ewb]: Please visit <http://www.ewb-international.org> to know more about Engineers without Borders International and <https://esf.org.br> for information on the Brazilian office.

The TDP has also received feedback from Brazilian computer programmers and policy analists. In 2017 and 2018, Transparência Brasil announced two team programming competitions, called 'Tá de Pé Hackathons', where contributors could fix code bugs and suggest new functionalities to the TDP project. One of these innovations consists of a Twitter bot (<https://twitter.com/tadepeapp>) which posts a message on the social network each time a user submits a new picture for evaluation. This allows interested parties to track the progress of construction sites as well as add new public works to the TDP database.  

# Data and Methods
\label{sec:methods}

Between August 2017 and August 2018, we implemented two interventions to measure the effect of the TDP app on six school construction outcomes. The outcomes are: 1) the percentage of public investment allocated to school constructions; 2) the difference between the percentage invested in the beginning and the end of the interventions; 3) the number of finished constructions; 4) the number of cancelled constructions; 5) the number of updated conclusion dates; 6) a placebo outcome indicating the percentage of the investment executed before the impact evaluation started. We expect the first five factors to increase the last to remain unchanged.

The first intervention was carried out from August 2017 to February 2018 using the Android version of the TDP app. The unit of analysis for this experiment is the Brazilian municipality. We randomly selected 150 cities to the control group and included 1030 municipalities in the treatment group. Our control condition consisted in removing all school constructions in the chosen municipalities so that citizens were unable to add information on them. 

To evaluate the random assignment, we used the following pre-treatment variables: 1) log of municipal population in 2015; 2) log of number of poor families in each city; 3) log of total federal transfers to the municipality in 2016; 4) federal government indicator for primary school quality; 4) federal government indicator for secondary school quality. The data come from the Brazilian Ministry of Education and the Census. Balance tests show that randomisation was successful and are available in the Supplementary Material. Figure \ref{fig:manipulation1} presents two manipulation checks, TDP app downloads by municipality and app downloads over time.

** FIGURE 2 ABOUT HERE: MANIPULATION CHECKS FOR INTERVENTION 1**

The map displays a good territorial variability. There were 455 downloads in the 1030 municipalities originally in the dataset at the beginning of the impact evaluation. Downloads peak during the Facebook TDP campaign, right after the TDP app launch in August, then diminishes over time. Users downloaded the app in 44.6% of the municipalities, and the downloads were temporally concentrated.

The second intervention is similar to intervention 1 in all but three characteristics. First, the TDP app was then available for iOS devices. Also, the randomisation procedure was performed at the school level, with 654 control and 3895 treatment units. We used blocked randomisation stratified by Brazilian state, school construction status (under construction, stopped, unfinished) and whether the municipality spent more on school construction that the distribution median. Finally, the intervention period lasted from August 2018 to February 2019.

** FIGURE 3 ABOUT HERE: MANIPULATION CHECKS FOR INTERVENTION 2** 

In total, 433 municipalities downloaded the app. There is one download peak in August 2017, right after the intervention starts, and a second spike around December. The number of downloads is considerably smaller in this second intervention when compared with intervention 1. 

# Results
\label{sec:results}

Table \ref{tab:results1} summarises the main results of intervention 1. We estimated the models including the five control variables described in the previous section and Brazilian states' fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered at the level of the municipality. As robustness tests, we run the main models using inverse probability weights where we used block randomisation and one-to-one nearest neighbourhood matching. The results are substantively identical and are available in the Supplementary Materials.
