abstract: "We study the effect of a mobile phone application designed to increase citizens' ability to monitor public works in Brazil. The app allowed individuals to find delayed school constructions in XXX Brazilian cities and send anonymous messages to politicians requestions information about construction delays and expected completion times. Our results show that the app has a null impact on the completion times subsequently reported by the municipalities. Additionally, we find that few politicians reacted to citizens' requests. These findings suggest it is difficult to motivate bottom-up accountability in new democracies, especially when politicians are unresponsive to non-electoral pressures. This paper has implications for the design of bottom-up accountability mechanisms."

# Introduction
\label{sec:intro}

One of the key determinants of efficient public service provision is a robust accountability system [@besley2003incentives; @cameron2004public; @ferejohn1986incumbent; @o1998horizontal]. In its standard definition, accountability is understood as the process of holding authorities responsible for their actions [@finer1941administrative; @mulgan2000accountability; @o1990bureaucratic]. Past studies show that accountability ensures that politicians act on behalf of voters [@freire2010ngp; @moncrieffe1998reconceptualizing], reduces the opportunities for rent-seeking and corruption [@deininger2005does; @wenar2006accountability] and improves the efficiency of the public sector [@adsera2003you; @bjorkman2009power]. Moreover, greater accountability leads to higher economic growth as it limits state discretion in the economy, promotes social cohesion and increases long-term investments in human capital [@benhabib2010economic; @suebvises2018social; @ponzetto2018social].

However, accountability systems can take many forms. One promising model for democratic oversight is _bottom-up monitoring_, in which citizens receive information about the shortcomings of a given project to help them evaluate and pressure underperforming public officials [@kosack2014does; @molina2016community; @raffler2018weakness]. Proponents suggest bottom-up accountability is effective because 1) constituents have first-hand information about the outcomes of local policies; 2) citizens have incentives to avoid corruption that directly affects them; 3) policy-makers are particularly sensitive to social punishment from their own communities [@serra2011combining, 570]. In a nutshell, bottom-up accountability offers a potential solution to the principal-agent dilemma in public service by aligning the interests of politicians and bureaucrats with those of the constituency they serve [@barro1973control; @raffler2018weakness, 2].

Here we assess the impact of a technology-driven solution that lowers the costs of evaluating public works and punishing political representatives in Brazil. Developed by Transparência Brasil[^transparencia], the _Tá de Pé_ (TDP) mobile phone application allows Brazilian citizens to know the location of public school construction sites, check their completion status, and anonymously request information from competent authorities. TDP users can also take pictures of delayed works and submit them to a group of trained engineers for examination. If the engineers classify the construction as delayed, TDP sends a message to the mayor's office asking for completion estimates and explanations about the construction status. TDP has been online since April 2017 in 1030 Brazilian municipalities and was the winner of the 2016 Google Social Impact grant with more than 200 thousand popular votes[^google].

[^transparencia]: Transparência Brasil is an non-governmental organisation whose mission is to 'promote transparency and social control of public power' in Brazil. It has been active since April 2000, is non-partisan and receives no public funding. More information at <http://transparencia.org.br> (access: July 2019).  

[^google]: About 1,000 Brazilian charities participated in the 2016 Google Social Impact Challenge and an independent selection committee selected 10 of them as finalists. Transparência Brasil was then the highest voted NGO by the public. To know more about the contest, please visit <https://impactchallenge.withgoogle.com/brazil2016> (access: July 2019). 

We used TDP to conduct **two/three?** experimental interventions. We tested whether the app has a positive impact on **school completion rates, school construction status and complaints to competent authorities**. Contrary to our expectations, the TDP app has delivered mixed results. **One/Two** of the findings are positive and in line with our theoretical predictions. From August 2017 to February 2019, TDP increased the likelihood of school completion by 6.8 percent (SE = X.X, t-test = XXX). Additionally, we find that pressure over the bureaucracy increased the investments in the schools by 157.5 percent (SE = X.XX, t-test = XXX). In contrast, our results show the app had a null impact on school constructions statistics. Brazilian politicians did not respond to the citizen's requests placed via the application. Therefore, our findings raise questions about the ability of citizens to hold representatives accountable using bottom-up strategies. **Nota**: _Reescrever essa última frase e colocar mais explicações sobre possíveis mecanismos, etc_    

# The _Tá de Pé_ Project \label{sec:tdp}

The _Tá de Pé_[^tdp] cell phone application is an initiative carried out by Transparência Brasil to foster bottom-up accountability in the Brazilian public sector. More specifically, the main goal of the TDP project is to improve responsiveness in government education expenditures. The TDP app incentivises citizens to provide up-to-date information about unfinished schools in their neighbourhoods, and the data will be assessed by a group of independent specialists. In the case the construction is behind schedule, TDP provides a writing platform whereby citizens can contact their representatives quickly and anonymously. The app then sends a notification to the mayor's office, which has 15 days to reply. If they do not respond to the request, a notification goes to the federal government, making it harder to the municipality to access federal funds in the future. The motivation for the intervention is that information delivery causes individuals to closely monitor public works. This, in turn, results in better social outcomes as public agents become more responsive to community demands. 

[^tdp]: _Tá de Pé_ is an informal Brazilian expression for 'is it done?'. Literally, it means 'standing on its feet' in Portuguese.

We built the app in the first three months of 2017 and tested it in May 2017. The first stable Android version was deployed on Google Play on 14 August 2017. A version for iOS appeared six months later. A massive Facebook campaign started in order to publicise the app. Facebook is the most widely used social media network in Brazil with around 72 million users in 2017 [@statista2019facebook]. The campaigns were concentrated in October 2017, investing around BRL 14.333,74 (US$ 4.479,29), and attracting 2,028 new users in October 2017 only.

Transparência Brasil established a partnership with the Brazilian branch of _Engineers without Borders_ (EWB), a non-governmental organisation dedicated to promote international development[^ewb], to provide unbiased evaluations of school completion rates. Their assessment is based on photos and GPS location sent through the app. All data are collected anonymously and neither organisation are able to identify which user uploaded the images. Information on users' alerts are stored on their mobile devices, so citizens can track whether their request has been answered by public authorities. 

[^ewb]: Please visit <http://www.ewb-international.org> to know more about Engineers without Borders International and <https://esf.org.br> for information on the Brazilian office.

The TDP has also received feedback from Brazilian computer programmers and policy analists. In 2017 and 2018, Transparência Brasil announced two team programming competitions, called 'Tá de Pé Hackathons', where contributors could fix code bugs and suggest new functionalities to TDP. In total, 75 participants 

# Methods
\label{sec:methods}

## Estimation
\label{sub:estimation}

Our regression model is specified as follows:

$$Y_{i} = \alpha + \beta T_{i} + \gamma X_{i} + \theta Z_i + \epsilon_{i} $$

Where $i$ indexes the case. $Y_i$ in one the outcomes we described in the previous subsection. The $\beta$ coefficient is the quantity of interest (Average Treatment Effect). $T_i$ is a binary treatment indicator in which zero denotes that $i$ is in the control group, while 1 indicates that $i$ received the treatment. $\gamma$ is a vector of fixed effects and $X_i$ is a matrix of 27 Brazilian states' fixed effects. $\theta$ is a vector of additional controls and $Z_i$ is an array of control variables for the case $i$. Lastly, $\epsilon_i$ is the error term.

We cluster the standard errors at the municipal level, as the investment decisions are taken by the mayor’s offices.
As robustness, we fit two extra models. First, we re-run the main model where we have the following: (i) we ran a model without controls or fixed effects; (ii) we run the models adding the control variables, which are the same as the ones used in the covariate balance tests; (iii) we run the regression model with State fixed effects. The results are in the Appendix.
Second, we run the main models using inverse probability weights where we used block randomization and a one-to-one nearest neighborhood matching. We use the control variables as matching characteristics. These robustness checks are intended to correct the imbalance caused by the minimal control group approach that we employed in all three interventions.
