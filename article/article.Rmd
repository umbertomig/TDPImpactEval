abstract: "We study the effect of a mobile phone application designed to increase citizens' ability to monitor public works in Brazil. The app allows individuals to find delayed school constructions in 1030 Brazilian cities and send anonymous messages to politicians requesting information about construction delays and completion times. Our results show the app has a null impact on the completion times subsequently reported by the municipalities. Additionally, we find that few politicians react to citizens' requests. These findings suggest it is difficult to motivate bottom-up accountability in new democracies, especially when politicians are unresponsive to non-electoral pressures. This paper has implications for the design of bottom-up accountability mechanisms."

# Introduction
\label{sec:intro}

One of the key determinants of efficient public services provision is a robust accountability system [@besley2003incentives; @cameron2004public; @ferejohn1986incumbent; @o1998horizontal]. In its standard definition, accountability is understood as the process of holding authorities responsible for their actions [@finer1941administrative; @mulgan2000accountability; @o1990bureaucratic]. Past studies show that accountability has a positive impact on governance, as it ensures that politicians act on behalf of voters [@freire2010ngp; @moncrieffe1998reconceptualizing], reduces the opportunities for rent-seeking and corruption [@deininger2005does; @wenar2006accountability] and improves the efficiency of the public sector [@adsera2003you; @bjorkman2009power]. Recent research also suggests accountability leads to higher economic growth because it limits state discretion in the economy and increases long-term investments in human capital [@benhabib2010economic; @suebvises2018social; @ponzetto2018social].

However, accountability systems take many forms. One promising model is that of _bottom-up monitoring_, in which citizens receive information about the shortcomings of a given project so they can evaluate and pressure underperforming public officials [@kosack2014does; @molina2016community; @raffler2018weakness]. Proponents argue bottom-up accountability is effective because: 1) constituents have first-hand information about the outcomes of local policies; 2) citizens have incentives to attack corruption that directly affects them; 3) policy-makers are sensitive to social punishment from their own communities [@serra2011combining, 570]. In a nutshell, bottom-up accountability offers a potential solution to the principal-agent dilemma in public service by aligning the interests of state officials with those of the constituency they serve [@barro1973control; @raffler2018weakness, 2].

Here we assess the impact of _Tá de Pé_ (TDP), a mobile phone application designed to lower the costs of evaluating public works and punishing political representatives in Brazil. Developed by Transparência Brasil[^transparencia], TDP allows Brazilian citizens to know the location of public school construction sites, check their completion status and anonymously request information from competent authorities. TDP users can also take pictures of the construction sites and submit them to volunteering engineers for examination. If the engineers classify the construction as delayed, TDP prompts users to send a message to the mayor's office asking for completion estimates and explanations about the construction status. TDP has been online since April 2017 in 1030 Brazilian municipalities and was the winner of the 2016 Google Social Impact grant with more than 200,000 popular votes[^google].

[^transparencia]: Transparência Brasil is an non-governmental organisation whose mission is to 'promote transparency and social control of public power' in Brazil. It has been active since April 2000, is non-partisan and receives no public funding. More information at <http://transparencia.org.br> (access: July 2019).  

[^google]: About 1,000 Brazilian charities participated in the 2016 Google Social Impact Challenge. An independent committee selected 10 organisations as finalists, and Transparência Brasil won the challenge with about 200,000 popular votes. To know more about the contest, please visit <https://impactchallenge.withgoogle.com/brazil2016> (access: July 2019). 

We use the TDP app to conduct two experimental interventions and test whether it has an impact on six outcomes related to school completion rates and complains to public authorities. We find that the TDP app increased the likelihood of school completion by 6.8 percent (SE = X.XX, t-test = X.XX) in the first experiment, although the effect is null in the second intervention. Additionally, we find that pressure over the bureaucracy increased the investments in the schools by 157.5 percent (SE = X.XX, t-test = X.XX) in the second experiment. However, our results show that providing information to citizens does not change the percentage invested in all other outcomes. 

In contrast, our results show the app has a null impact on school constructions statistics. Brazilian politicians did not respond to the citizen's requests placed via the application. 

Our findings raise questions about the ability of citizens to hold representatives accountable using bottom-up strategies. Although

# The _Tá de Pé_ Project 
\label{sec:tdp}

The _Tá de Pé_[^tdp] cell phone application is an initiative carried out by Transparência Brasil to foster bottom-up accountability in the Brazilian public sector. More specifically, the main goal of the TDP project is to improve responsiveness in government education expenditures. The TDP app incentivises citizens to provide up-to-date information about unfinished schools in their neighbourhoods, and that information will be assessed by a group of independent specialists. In the case the construction is behind schedule, TDP provides a writing platform whereby citizens can contact their representatives quickly and anonymously. The app then prompts citizen to write a notification to the mayor's office, which has 15 days to reply. If they do not respond to the request, the app forwards the notification to the Brazilian federal government, making it harder to the municipality to access federal funds in the future. The motivation for the intervention is that information delivery causes individuals to closely monitor public works. This, in turn, results in better social outcomes as public agents become more responsive to community demands. 

[^tdp]: _Tá de Pé_ is an informal Brazilian expression for 'is it done?'. Literally, it means 'standing on its feet' in Portuguese.

We built the app in the first three months of 2017 and tested it in May 2017. The first stable Android version was deployed on Google Play on 14 August 2017. A version for iOS appeared six months later. A massive Facebook campaign started in order to publicise the app. Facebook is the most widely used social media network in Brazil with around 72 million users in 2017 [@statista2019facebook]. The campaigns were concentrated in October 2017 and cost US$ 4,479.29. Facebook advertisements attracted 2,028 new users to the platform in October 2017 only.

Transparência Brasil partnered with the Brazilian branch of _Engineers without Borders_ (EWB), a non-governmental organisation[^ewb], to provide technical evaluations of school completion rates. The EWB bases their assessment on photos and GPS location sent through the app. The engineers' reports are later uploaded to the database and stored on the users' mobile devices so citizens can track the progress of the constructions. 

[^ewb]: Please visit <http://www.ewb-international.org> to know more about Engineers without Borders International and <https://esf.org.br> for information on the Brazilian office.

The TDP has also received feedback from Brazilian computer programmers and policy analists. In 2017 and 2018, Transparência Brasil announced two team programming competitions, called 'Tá de Pé Hackathons', where contributors could fix code bugs and suggest new functionalities to the TDP project. One of these innovations consists of a Twitter bot (<https://twitter.com/tadepeapp>) which posts a message on the social network each time a user submits a new picture for evaluation. This allows interested parties to track the progress of construction sites as well as add new public works to the TDP database.  

# Data and Methods
\label{sec:methods}

We assessed the impact of the TDP app on  

## Estimation
\label{sub:estimation}

Our regression model is specified as follows:

$$Y_{i} = \alpha + \beta T_{i} + \gamma X_{i} + \theta Z_i + \epsilon_{i} $$

Where $i$ indexes the case. $Y_i$ in one the outcomes we described in the previous subsection. The $\beta$ coefficient is the quantity of interest (Average Treatment Effect). $T_i$ is a binary treatment indicator in which zero denotes that $i$ is in the control group, while 1 indicates that $i$ received the treatment. $\gamma$ is a vector of fixed effects and $X_i$ is a matrix of 27 Brazilian states' fixed effects. $\theta$ is a vector of additional controls and $Z_i$ is an array of control variables for the case $i$. Lastly, $\epsilon_i$ is the error term.

We cluster the standard errors at the municipal level, as the investment decisions are taken by the mayor’s offices.
As robustness, we fit two extra models. First, we re-run the main model where we have the following: (i) we ran a model without controls or fixed effects; (ii) we run the models adding the control variables, which are the same as the ones used in the covariate balance tests; (iii) we run the regression model with State fixed effects. The results are in the Appendix.
Second, we run the main models using inverse probability weights where we used block randomization and a one-to-one nearest neighborhood matching. We use the control variables as matching characteristics. These robustness checks are intended to correct the imbalance caused by the minimal control group approach that we employed in all three interventions.
