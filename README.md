> **Abstract**: Does grassroots participation improve public service provision? We study the effect of a mobile phone application that allows citizens to monitor school construction projects in 1030 Brazilian municipalities. The app provides a platform where users can submit photos of construction sites, consult independent engineers, and contact their representatives about project delays. Our results show the app has a null impact on public spending and school completion times. Additionally, we find that politicians do not react to individual requests. The results suggest it is difficult to motivate bottom-up accountability in new democracies and question the impact of local monitoring on the quality of public services.
